ProjectNodeJs-Medicine

This project is a Backend RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to manage medicine-related data in a medical or pharmacy system. It provides structured and scalable endpoints to perform core CRUD operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting medicines.

The project follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture to ensure clean code organization, separation of concerns, and easy maintenance. It is suitable for integration with web or mobile applications and includes middleware support for request handling, data validation, and error management.

This repository serves as a practical example of building a well-structured Node.js API for educational and real-world backend development purposes.
